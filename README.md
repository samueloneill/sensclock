# Sensclock - a sensory alarm clock and daily organiser for children with autism
This project for Arduino is aimed at assisting children with autism with their daily tasks. Research into autism spectrum disorder showed that common side effects include difficulty with organisation and communication. The device, targeted at children between 8-13 and their parents, aims to combat these problems by offering the user an all-in-one alarm clock, scheduling and mood tracking solution. 
The time is displayed on a series of dot matrix displays, allowing for customisable patterns and colours, while the user's schedule, instructions and feedback messages are shown on an LCD display. An RGB neopixel LED ring provides a highly customisable sensory night-light. Children can set and manage alarms using the device, as well as share their current mood. Using a companion mobile application, parents and carers can also control the features of the device.

# Scheduling and mood tracking
To help the carer deal with the child's ASD more efficiently, the companion app can be used to remotely conifgure the device, as well as track the child's mood whenever they use the 'mood buttons'. Mood buttons can either trigger a quick suggestion on the device's LCD display, or alert the carer so that they may respond as they choose. Mood data is also stored on an SD card to allow the user to monitor mood over a period of time. A carer may also create a schedule which will be displayed on the LCD at the appropriate time.

# Companion application
An Android application allows detailed control over the device's features:
 - Alarm
    - control the sound of the alarm to prevent hypersensitivity to noise
    - control lighting when the alarm is triggered
 - Lighting
    - change colours, patterns and brightness of the lighting
 - Scheduling
    - create and edit a schedule
